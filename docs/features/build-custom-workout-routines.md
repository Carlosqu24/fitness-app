# Build custom workout routines

## Implementation

### UI
Based on Figma mockups, a stepperForm will be made (form with steps)
- Exercise selection
- Establish approximate sets (series) ** LEAVE LAST
- Set frequency days
- Validate information ** NOT CONFIRMED YET

### Data
I am going to obtain the exercises from a Supabase table in which I am going to group them by main muscle worked

### Functionality
I will look for custom hooks of stepperForm, if not I will develop the logic
